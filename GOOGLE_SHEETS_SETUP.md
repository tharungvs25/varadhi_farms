   - **Cabins**: Will store all cabin data

## Step 2: Set Up Google Apps Script

1. In your Google Sheet, click on **Extensions** ‚Üí **Apps Script**
2. Delete any existing code in the editor
3. Open the file `GoogleAppsScript.gs` in your project folder
4. **Copy ALL the code** from that file
5. **Paste it** into the Apps Script editor
6. Click the **üíæ Save** icon (or press Ctrl+S)
7. Name the project "Varahi Farms API" (or any name you prefer)

## Step 3: Deploy the Web App

1. In the Apps Script editor, click **Deploy** ‚Üí **New deployment**
2. Click the ‚öôÔ∏è gear icon next to "Select type"
3. Choose **Web app**

   - Click **Authorize access**
   - Choose your Google account
   - Click **Advanced** ‚Üí **Go to Varahi Farms API (unsafe)**
   - Click **Allow**
7. **Copy the Web app URL** - it will look like:
   ```
   https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycby.../exec
   ```

## Step 4: Configure Your React Native App

1. Open the file: `src/services/googleSheets.ts`
2. Find the `GOOGLE_SHEETS_CONFIG` object at the top:
   ```typescript
   const GOOGLE_SHEETS_CONFIG = {
     spreadsheetUrl: 'YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEETS_URL_HERE',
     scriptUrl: 'YOUR_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL_HERE'
   };
   ```
3. Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL_HERE` with the Web app URL you copied
4. Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEETS_URL_HERE` with your Google Sheet URL (from the browser address bar)
5. Save the file

## Step 5: Share Your Google Sheet (Optional)

If you want others to view the data:
1. Click the **Share** button in the top-right of your Google Sheet
2. Add email addresses or get a shareable link
3. Set permissions:
   - **Viewer**: Can only view data
   - **Editor**: Can edit data directly in the sheet

## Step 6: Test the Integration

1. Open your Expo app
2. Add a new batch or cabin
3. Check your Google Sheet - the data should appear automatically!
4. Try deleting a batch - it should be removed from the sheet too
