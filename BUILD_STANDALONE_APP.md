# Building Standalone App for Varahi Farms

## 🎯 **Goal**: Create an installable APK that doesn't need Expo Go or development server

---

## 📱 **Method 1: EAS Build (Recommended - Free for Development)**

### **Step 1: Install EAS CLI**
```bash
npm install -g eas-cli
```

### **Step 2: Login to Expo**
```bash
eas login
```
(Create a free account at expo.dev if you don't have one)

### **Step 3: Configure Your Project**
```bash
cd "d:\Desktop\projects\Pms lovable\chick-chatter-main\vardhi-farms-app"
eas build:configure
```

### **Step 4: Build APK for Android**
```bash
eas build -p android --profile preview
```

This will:
- Build your app in the cloud (takes 10-20 minutes)
- Generate a downloadable APK file
- You can install this APK directly on any Android phone
- **No need for Expo Go or development server!**

### **Step 5: Download & Install**
- After build completes, you'll get a download link
- Download the APK to your phone
- Install it (allow "Install from unknown sources" if prompted)
- Done! Your app works independently now 🎉

## 📱 **Method 2: Expo Development Build (Faster Testing)**

If you want a middle ground - faster than EAS but still requires some setup:

### **Step 1: Create Development Build**
```bash
npx expo install expo-dev-client
eas build --profile development --platform android
```

### **Step 2: Install the Dev Build APK**
- Download and install the generated APK
- This custom app replaces Expo Go
- Still connects to your dev server but faster & more stable

---

## 🌐 **Method 3: Expo Publish (Simplest - Works with Expo Go)**

This doesn't create a standalone app, but makes it easier to access:

### **Step 1: Publish Your App**
```bash
cd "d:\Desktop\projects\Pms lovable\chick-chatter-main\vardhi-farms-app"
npx expo publish
```

### **Step 2: Access Anytime**
- Open Expo Go app
- Your app appears in "Recently opened" or "Profile" section
- Tap to launch - no need to scan QR code again!
- App loads from Expo servers (needs internet first time)

## 💡 **Which Method Should You Choose?**

### **For Daily Farm Use (Production):**
✅ **Use Method 1 (EAS Build APK)**
- Creates independent app
- Works offline completely
- No Expo Go needed
- Professional experience
- One-time setup, use forever

### **For Development/Testing:**
✅ **Use Method 3 (Expo Publish)**
- Quick updates
- No build time
- Easy to test changes
- Requires Expo Go

### **For Advanced Users:**
✅ **Use Method 2 (Development Build)**
- Best of both worlds
- Custom native code support
- Faster than Expo Go
